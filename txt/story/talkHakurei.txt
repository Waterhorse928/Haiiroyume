"Reimu, I think you might want to take a look around."
Reimu starts to snore loudly.
"I know you aren't asleep!"
"Look up! Does it usually look like that above the shrine?"
Reimu:"What are you-"
As she looked up she could see the gray and black void.
Reimu: *sigh*
Reimu: "Figures there's some sort of incident."
Reimu: "I was having a nice nap too..."
She doesn't seem that surprised at all...
You remember that an incident is some sort of unusual phenomenon with an agenda.
Reimu's job is to find the one responsible and beat them up.
At least that's how it works wherever she comes from.
Reimu: "Hey, you don't look like you're from the Human Village."
Reimu: "Who are you?"
Good question...
"Uh, I think I'm Gate?"
"And I might be lost?"
"And I don't know where I'm from?"
"Or why I'm here?"
"Or why any of this is happening?!"
Suddenly the questions you'd been avoiding crash in on you.
You can feel your throat constrict and your heart start to race.
Reimu: "Whoa there, how about you sit down for a second?"
Reimu: "That's it, breathe a bit."
You let Reimu guide you to sit down under the veranda.
Reimu: "Just sit there and relax, I'll go figure out what's going on."
You close your eyes to focus on breathing and trying to calm down a bit.
...
...
...
You start to feel a bit better.
Then you heard Reimu make a sound somewhere between a sigh and a growl.
You open your eyes to see Reimu seemingly just standing there.
"Are you alright?"
Reimu: "I can't fly for some reason."
Reimu: "All my tools are gone too."
Reimu: "Grr..."
