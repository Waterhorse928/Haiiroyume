Reimu collapses to the ground.
"Reimu!"
You jump out from behind a bush and rush over.
Your vision starts to lighten.
She isn't moving.
You reach out to her.
Your vision fades completely to white.
You lose sense of your surroundings.
...
...
...
Reimu: "Well, that was annoying."
You open your eyes and look around.
"We're back?"
Reimu: "Looks like we got teleported out when we failed to defeat her."
"Ah..."
You're glad Reimu isn't dead, but you're too embarrassed to admit it.
Sure enough, you and Reimu are back at the Hakurei Shine, sitting under the veranda.
Behind you the gate's still open.
"I guess we can try again."
"I wonder if there's a limit on how many times we can try..."
Reimu: "I don't think there is."
Reimu: "The thingy would probably say so."
"Yeah, that seems right."
