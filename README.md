# Project-Labyrinth

TL:DR: this is a game. it works sometimes.

LABYRINTH is a rogue-like turn-based party-combat story game.
Progress through the Labyrinth by defeating AI-controlled enemies.
Defeated enemies can be recruited to your roster.
Before each combat, draft a team of four characters from your roster to your party.
Your progress is automatically saved at the end of each combat, and when you finish a story chapter. (Instructions for editing saves/custom saves forthcoming)
Beyond the scope of the initial tutorial, you do not have to play levels in any order.
Learn each characters abilities by using them in a combat.

Feel free to explore and be creative, there is no one strategy to win.

(there is no loading screen for us to put tips, so here's one: watch for patterns in boss actions, spending and targets)
